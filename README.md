# Rules

My_sokoban is a game where you need to put every 'X' of the map on the place of the 'O'. If you block the 'X' on a corner, the game will automatically detect it and make you leave. If you win, it will leave the game and print that you won ! Congrats!

If you want to restart the game, just press space and the map will reset.

## Start the game.

Use the makefile to build the game.

```bash
make
```

Use the lauching game command and choose which map you want to play on inside the folder "map".

```bash
./my_sokoban map/map_you_want_to_play_on
```
